# React Native Asynchronous Operation Handling Error

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered in React Native applications when working with asynchronous operations within the `useEffect` hook. The core problem involves inconsistent handling of asynchronous responses, particularly when multiple requests are made in rapid succession.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file shows the original code which has a race condition.  The `fetch` requests may complete out of order, leading to unpredictable component states.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a more robust implementation that mitigates the issues caused by asynchronous operations. This includes more careful management of state and handling of potential errors.
